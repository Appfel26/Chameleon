group_setting_text: "Hey, you want to change the settings of how I work in your group, great. Let me explain the settings:\n\n
<b>Refresh</b>: Refresh these settings. Use it in case you think another admin changed them.
<b>Language</b>: Change the language of me in your group. If you want to learn more about how you can add your own language, go to @TheChameleonSupport\n\n
<b>Deck</b>: The deck of cards I use in your group. You can add your own, head over to @TheChameleonSupport to learn how.\n\n
<b>Fewer</b>: If only three players are playing (and this is activated), the chameleon, if caught, gets two guesses.\n\n
<b>More</b>: If 7 or 8 players are playing (and this is activated), the words vanish once everyone has said their word, making it harder for the chameleon to guess the correct one.\n\n
<b>Tournament</b>: If this mode is activated, a scoring system is introduced. If the chameleon escapes undetected, it gets two points. If it gets caught and guesses the correct word, it gets one point. If it doesn't, the player get two points each. The first player making it to 5 points wins.\n\n
<b>Pin</b>: Once activated, I will silently pin the word list so players can find it easier once a game is started. I will pin the old pinned message (if existing) silently again when the game ends. In order to activate this setting, you need to make me an admin with pin privileges.\n\n
<b>Restricting</b>: Once activated, I will restrict everyone from writing except the person whose turn it is during the word saying phase. Everyone can write again after this phase is over. In order for this to work, I will promote those users to admins with add member rights, since admins aren't restricted. The original chat permissions are restored after the phase. In order to activate this setting, you need to make me an admin with add new admins and add members privileges."
